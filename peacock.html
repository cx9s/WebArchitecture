<h1>The Peacock and the Crane</h1>
<p>A Peacock spreading its gorgeous tail mocked a Crane that passed
    by, ridiculing the ashen hue of its plumage and saying, "I am
    robed, like a king, in gold and purple and all the colors of the
    rainbow; while you have not a bit of color on your wings."</p>
<p>"True," replied the Crane; "but I soar to the heights of heaven
    and lift up my voice to the stars, while you walk below, like a
    cock, among the birds of the dunghill."</p>
<p>Fine feathers don't make fine birds.</p>
